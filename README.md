# Team Profile Generator Assignment

The goal of this assignment was to create a program that utilized the inquirer package to enter data for members of a team and print them into an html document, and to use the jest package to perform TDD for the program.

Frist, I created class constructors for each employee role, then created the test files to test each class, and then created the index.js file to run the inquirer prompts.
